1. int row1 = loc1.getRow();
2. false
3. (3, 3)
4. 45
5. it may return the location that reached when going towards the direction form the location now.

1. int objNum = getOccupiedLocations();
   int emptyLocNum = getNumRows() * getNumCols() - getOccupiedLocations()
2. theGrid.isValid(new Location(10, 10));
3. because the Grid is just a interface, the implementations can be finded in class BoundedGrid and UnboundedGrid. 
4. yes. using array is more efficient than ArrayList. and there si no need to store values of different types in the array.

1. Position, Direction, Color
2. Location.NORTH 0, Color.BLUE (0, 0, 255)
3. Because the Actor has its own method, instead of just a empty shell. And why it should not be a interface but a class is because that all the actor have some method in common, so it should be fill in the Actor to avoid duplications.
4. No. There is a wrong massage says that "This actor is already contained in a grid."
   No. There is a wrong massage says that "This actor is not contained in a grid."
   Yes. The actor will apear in the location it finally puted itself in.
5. setDirection(getDirection() + Location.RIGHT);


1. if (!gr.isValid(next)) return false;
2. Actor neighbor = gr.get(next);
   return (neighbor == null) || (neighbor instanceof Flower);
   // if the next is a rock, then it return false.
3. boolean isValid(Location loc); 
       // to get whether the next location is out of grid
   E get(Location loc); 
       // to get the actor in the next location
4. Location getAdjacentLocation(int direction);
       // to get the next location the bug should move to
5. Location getLocation();
       // to get the location the bug is now.
   Grid<Actor> getGrid();
       // to get the grid the bug is in now
6. it will call removeSelfFromGrid() and remove itself form the grid and disapear.
7. Yes, it needed. When comes to flower.putSelfInGrid(gr, loc); the loc cant't be replaced by getLocation() because the location the bug is in now had been changed.
8. Because the new flower is created by "new Flower(getColor());" and the getColor() return the bug's color.
9. Yes, it does.
10. Flower flower = new Flower(getColor());
        flower.putSelfInGrid(gr, loc);
