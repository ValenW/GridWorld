Set7
1. void act();
   ArrayList<Actor> getActors();
   void processActors(ArrayList<Actor> actors);
   ArrayList<Location> getMoveLocations();
   Location selectMoveLocation(ArrayList<Location> locs);
   void makeMove(Location loc);
2. getActors, processActors, getMoveLocations, selectMoveLocation and makeMove.
3. Maybe. If the subclass want to look elsewhere for actors to process instead of just the neighboring actors.
***4. Call the actor's own mathods to process the actor, such as remove from the grid.
5. ArrayList<Location> getMoveLocations();
       // determine of which locations are candidates for the move
   Location selectMoveLocation(ArrayList<Location> locs);
       // select one of the candidates to move
   void makeMove(Location loc);
       // make the move
6. Because Critter extends form Actor, and there is no property to initialize in Critter, so use the Actor's constructor is ok.

Set8
1. Because the mathods that the act invokes was override.(procesActors, makeMove)
2. to avoid duplications.
3. Add 
       "Flower flower = new Flower(getColor());
        flower.putSelfInGrid(gr, loc);"
   before the super.makeMove() is called.
4. Because the ChameleonCritter just process the actor around it, so there is no need to override the getActors method.
5. The Actor class
6. Invoke the getGrid method.

Set9
1. Because it just want the actors in front, to the right-front, or to the left-front of it instead of all the actors around it.
2. First calls the getActors mathod to get the actors that should be eaten. Then the processActors method will be called, all the actors selected will call removeFormGrid method themselves.
3. To get the positions around in one or more directions.
   The mathod getAdjacentLocation can just return one pisition in one direction, but in this case there may be more than one direction and so more than one psition. So it is necessary to use a new method.
4. (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
5. CrabCritter can only move to the position on the left or right, but the Critter can move to all the 8 position around it.
   When CrabCritter can't move, it will turn 90 degrees, randomly to the left or right, while Critter doesn't turn any degrees.
   CrabCritter and Critter will both select one pisition form the candidate by the same posibility.
6. The position it will move to. 
   If it will move to the position it has already been, it turning,  otherwise moving.
7. In the processActors mathod, only when the actor isn't an instance of Critter, the actor will be eaten. Since the CrabCritter was extended from Critter, the CrabCritter will not be eaten as well.
